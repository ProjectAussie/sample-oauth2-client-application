This repo shows how to get started with the Embark API.

Prerequisites:

* A client application created by Embark, with your email address registered as the first application manager
* Your client application's ID and secret key

To run: `npm install`, then `npm start`, then go to localhost:3000 in the browser. Follow the links to give this application permission to read your Embark data, then view your Embark data queried by your application via the Embark API.
